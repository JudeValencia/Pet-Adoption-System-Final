Updated Ver of the previous Pet Adoption System. Made a new one caused I fucked up the previous version. 
Tangina mo Maven (Di lang jud ko kahibaw nya ni largo rakog gamit lmao).

Updates: 
  - Complete Admin Functions
  - Added a PDF Generator (Report Making)
  - Updates pet.txt whenever an adoption request is approved
  - Make a reject feature
  - Completely connect all features to build the full system

TODO: 
  - Update UI (Kamo na ani gais, lamuch)
  - Validations
  - Format of Remaining Pets report
  - Update the approval/rejection logic (Should show list of request ID's, Basic Information of the Customer and Pet. To fully review the request, the admin should use the                 search function by using the request ID)
